May Flower Cannon
=============================

May Flower Cannon
-----------------------------

The game consists of a cannon at the bottom of the browser window, that rotates with mouse movement and shoots flowers
when the mouse button is clicked (the cannon "loads" for a short time - it is not a machine gun).

Change log:

0.1.1 Eoma implemented a gravity system making the beers turn and fall back down.

0.1 Added collision detection

0.0.2 Fixed bug with positioning. Cleaner code and separation between code, css and html.
2 Beers were given away for this to happen!

0.0.1 - experimental 1st commit with the cannon shooting beers.

Contributors: eoma and ljos. Both were given beers.

13 years later: Forked in to a healthy fix of the branch and to be patched with flower and not use beer to shoot with. 

The leftover patching for release of css demo is to make gravity better for 1080x1920 resolution and bring it in to full screen.
